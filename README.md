# üìº rek≈çdƒÅ - Automatic Twitch Recorder
 > Rek≈çdƒÅ, „É¨„Ç≥„ÉÄ - means <i>Recorder</i> in Japanese

Is a CLI tool inspired by [```streamlink```](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink) but with more capabilities. Mainly used to run in the background.
Just _run'n'forget_. It endlessly watches multiple twitch.tv channels you added to come online and starts recording/downloading them simultaneously into local MPEGTS ```.ts``` files which can be played via Video Player

Your best new friend for your Kappa needs

# ü§© It's awesome!  Here's why
- üí™ **Powerful**. Record **multiple** live streams simultaneously. It's like ```streamlink``` on steroids
- ü§è **Small**. Single **~10 MB** binary file solution
- 0Ô∏è‚É£  **Independent**. Zero run-time dependency. Does not depends on ```ffmpeg``` or ```streamlink```
- üß† **Smart**. Avoids making lot of files. If stream goes down, it waits and tries to reconnect to continue writing into the same file.
- ‚öô **Efficient**. Low CPU and RAM usage. ~20 MB average RAM usage
- üöÄ **Crossplatform**. Supports ```Windows```, ```Linux```, ```macOS```, ```Raspberry Pi (arm)``` and other OS & platforms
